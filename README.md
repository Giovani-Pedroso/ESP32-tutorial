# Hello, Ola, Hola

Wellcome to this repository I am using it to keep track of my studies of this worderful board (wifi, bluetooth, 2 × 8-bit DACs, 4 × SPI, 2 × Interfaces I²S, 2 × Interfaces I²C, 3 × UART) alot of stuff and with alot of stuff came a lot of things to stude. here is the programs I made to apply this periferals.

# ESP-IDF

ESP-IDF(IoT Development Framework ) is the official framework to programm the ESPs boards (ESP32, ESP32-S and ESP32-C) and it is what i am using in this 
repository, but why use the ESP-IDF if is possible to use the arduino framework that is simpler and have better protabilite, good questions, first for the 
simplicity yes it is unquestiable that the arduino is the easier than ESP-IDF but this simplicity came with a price that can make your programs slower that the
native framework, for the protabilite a protatle code also mean a limited code because it exclude some elements that are exclusive from a family on 
microcontroleers.

# What I am using to code

To code I am using Emacs to write the programs and the CLI version of the PlatformIO to do the upload 
but i do not recomend this configurantion I am only using it because my PC a laptop power by a C-70 amd processor do not get along with vscode that i recoment you to use it with the PlatformIO extencion
